    <h2>Why Dogs are better than Cats</h2>

    <p>
       
        Dogs are better than cats because dogs are super loyal 
        and loving. They come in different types to fit your lifestyle, 
        whether you want a protector, a helper, or a fun companion. 
        Dogs are playful and can learn tricks, which is enjoyable. 
        Plus, having a dog often helps you meet new friends when you 
        go for walks or visit dog parks.
